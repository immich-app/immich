# OpenAPI

Immich uses the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) standard to generate API documentation. To view the published docs see [here](../api).

## Generator

OpenAPI is used to generate the client (Typescript, Dart) SDK. `openapi-generator-cli` can be installed [here](https://openapi-generator.tech../installation/). The generated SDK is based on the `immich-openapi-specs.json` file, which is autogenerated by the server **when running in development mode**. The `immich-openapi-specs.json` file can be modified with `@nestjs/swagger` decorators used or referenced by controller endpoints. See the [NestJS OpenAPI docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/types-and-parameters) for more info. When you add a new endpoint or modify an existing one, you must run the server in development mode and run the command below to update the client SDK.

```bash
make open-api
```

You can find the generated client SDK in the `open-api/typescript-sdk/client` for Typescript SDK and `mobile/openapi` for Dart SDK.
