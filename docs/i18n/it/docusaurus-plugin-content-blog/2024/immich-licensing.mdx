Hello everybody,

Firstly, on behalf of the Immich team, I'd like to thank everybody for your continuous support of Immich since the very first day! Your contributions, encouragement, and community engagement have helped bring Immich to its current state. The team and I are forever grateful for that.

Since our [last announcement of the core team joining FUTO to work on Immich full-time](https://immich.app/blog/2024/immich-core-team-goes-fulltime), one of the goals of our new position is to foster a healthy relationship between the developers and the users. We believe that this enables us to create great software, establish transparent policies and build trust.

We want to build a great software application that brings value to you and your loved ones' lives. We are not using you as a product, i.e., selling or tracking your data. We are not putting annoying ads into our software. We respect your privacy. We want to be compensated for the hard work we put in to build Immich for you.

With those notes, we have enabled a way for you to financially support the continued development of Immich, ensuring the software can move forward and will be maintained, by offering a lifetime license of the software. We think if you like and use software, you should pay for it, but _we're never going to force anyone to pay or try to limit Immich for those who don't._

There are two types of license that you can choose to purchase: **Server License** and **Individual License**.

### Server License

This is a lifetime license costing **$99.99**. The license is applied to the whole server. You and all users that use your server are licensed.

### Individual License

This is a lifetime license costing **$24.99**. The license is applied to a single user, and can be used on any server they choose to connect to.

You can purchase the license on [our page - https://buy.immich.app](https://buy.immich.app).

Starting with release `v1.109.0` you can purchase and enter your purchased license key directly in the app.

# FAQ

### 1. Where can I purchase a license?

There are several places where you can purchase the license from

- [https://buy.immich.app](https://buy.immich.app)
- [https://pay.futo.org](https://pay.futo.org/)
- or directly from the app.

### 2. Do I need both _Individual License_ and _Server License_?

No,

If you are the admin and the sole user, or your instance has less than a total of 4 users, you can buy the **Individual License** for each user.

If your instance has more than 4 users, it is more cost-effective to buy the **Server License**, which will license all the users on your instance.

### 3. What do I do if I don't pay?

You can continue using Immich without any restriction.

### 4. Will there be any paywalled features?

No, there will never be any paywalled features.

### 5. Where can I get support regarding payment issues?

You can email us with your `orderId` and your email address `billing@futo.org` or on our Discord server.
