# Partner Sharing

Immich allows you to share your library with other users. They can then view your library and download the assets. You can manage Partner Sharing from the [User Settings](docs/features/user-settings.md) page on the web.

Partner sharing includes:

- Access to all non-archived and trashed photos and videos.
- Access to all metadata, including GPS information.
- Access to share assets via shared links, albums, etc.

Partner sharing does _not_ include:

- Already existing partner albums
- If an asset is favorited
- People and facial recognition data

:::note

- Partner sharing is one-way. To view your partner's assets, they must also share them with you.
- Partner sharing may result in displaying duplicate assets on the main timeline, as duplicates are only detected on a per-user basis.
