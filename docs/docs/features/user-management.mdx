# User Management

Immich supports multiple users, each with their own library.

## Register the Admin User

<RegisterAdminUser />

## Create a New User

<UserCreate />

## Delete a User

If you need to remove a user from Immich, head to "Administration", where users can be scheduled for deletion. The user account will immediately become disabled and their library and all associated data will be removed after 7 days.
