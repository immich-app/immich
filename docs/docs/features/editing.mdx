# Editing

Immich supports non-destructive editing of photos. This means that any edits you make to an asset do not modify the original file, but instead create a new version of the asset with the edits applied. You can always revert back to the original asset if needed.

## Supported Edits

Currently, Immich supports the following types of edits:

- Cropping
- Rotation
- Mirroring

<img src={require('./img/web-edit-interface.webp').default} title="Web edit interface" />

## Download

When you download an edited asset, Immich provides the edited version of the asset by default. However, you can choose to download the original version if needed.

<img src={require('./img/web-edit-download.webp').default} title="Web edit download" />
