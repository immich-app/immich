## Sync only selected photos

If you have a large number of photos on the device, and you would prefer not to backup all the photos, then it might be prudent to only backup selected photos from device to the Immich server.

First, you need to enable the Storage Indicator in your app's settings. Navigate to **<ins>Settings -> Photo Grid</ins>** and enable **"Show Storage indicator on asset tiles"**; this makes it easy to distinguish local-only assets and synced assets.

:::note

This will enable a small cloud icon on the bottom right corner of the asset tile, indicating that the asset is synced to the server:

1. <Icon path={mdiCloudOffOutline} size={1} /> - Local-only asset; not synced to the server
2. <Icon path={mdiCloudCheckOutline} size={1} /> - Asset is synced to the server

:::

Now make sure that the local album is selected in the backup screen (steps 1-2 above). You can find these albums listed in **<ins>Library -> On this device</ins>**. To selectively upload photos from these albums, simply select the local-only photos and tap on "Upload" button in the dynamic bottom menu.

## Free Up Space

The **Free Up Space** tool allows you to remove local media files from your device that have already been successfully backed up to your Immich server (and are not in the Immich trash). This helps reclaim storage on your mobile device without losing your memories.

### How it works

<img src={require('./img/free-up-space.webp').default} title="Free up space" />

1.  **Configuration:**
    - **Cutoff Date:** You can select a cutoff date. The tool will only look for photos and videos **on or before** this date.
    - **Filter Options:** You can choose to remove **All** assets, or restrict removal to **Photos only** or **Videos only**.
    - **Keep Favorites:** By default, local assets marked as favorites are preserved on your device, even if they match the cutoff date.
2.  **Scan & Review:** Before any files are removed, you are presented with a review screen to verify which items will be deleted.
3.  **Deletion:** Confirmed items are moved to your device's native Trash/Recycle Bin.

:::info reclaim storage
To permanently free up space, you must manually empty the system/gallery trash.

### iCloud Photos

If you use **iCloud Photos** alongside Immich, it is vital to understand how deletion affects your data. iCloud utilizes a two-way sync; this means deleting a photo from your iPhone to free up space will **also delete it from iCloud**.

Assets that are part of an **iCloud Shared Album** are automatically excluded from the cleanup scan because iCloud does not allow removing the items from the device.

### External App Dependencies (WhatsApp, etc.)

Android applications like **WhatsApp** rely on local files to display media in chat history.

If Immich backs up your WhatsApp folder and you run **Free Up Space**, the local copies of these images will be deleted. Consequently, **media in your WhatsApp chats will appear blurry or missing.** You will only be able to view these photos inside the Immich app; they will no longer be visible within the WhatsApp interface.

**Recommendation:** If keeping chat history intact is important, please ensure you review the deletion list carefully or consider excluding WhatsApp folders from the backup if you intend to use this feature frequently.

## Album Sync

You can sync or mirror an album from your phone to the Immich server on your account. For example, if you select Recents, Camera and Videos album for backup, the corresponding album with the same name will be created on the server. Once the assets from those albums are uploaded, they will be put into the target albums automatically.

### Album Synchronization Highlights

- **One-Way Sync:** Synchronization is one-way, from the device to the server.

- **Name Matching:** If an album on the server has the same name as the album on the device, images from the device will be merged with the existing images in the server album.

- **Shared Albums:** If the matching album on the server is shared, the new photos merged into the album will also be shared.

- **Album Structure:** When an album is created for the first time, its structure is based on the initial state. Future updates made on the phone (such as deleting or repositioning photos) will not be reflected in Immich.

- **User-Specific Sync:** Album synchronization is unique to each server user and does not sync between different users or partners.

- **Mobile-Only Feature:** Album synchronization is currently only available on mobile. For similar options on a computer, refer to [Libraries](/features/libraries) for further details.

### Synchronizing albums from the past

<img src={require('./img/backup-album-sync.webp').default} width="400px" title="Backup album synchronization option" />

Albums can be synchronized to the server even if they did not exist on the server before. You can enable this feature at any time and use the **Reorganize into album** button to backfill existing uploads into their corresponding albums.

:::info Sync albums delete/move photos
If you delete/move photos in the local album on your device, it will not be reflected in the album on the server **even if** you click Sync albums
It will only reflect files you add.

### Read-only/kid Mode

You can set the app to read-only mode to prevent accidental deletion of photos from your device, and only allowing viewing photos on the timeline.

To toggle this feature by long-pressing the profile icon. Or go to `Settings > Advanced > Read-only Mode`.
