# Account switching (web)

The web client can keep multiple signed-in accounts for the same Immich server so you can move between them without re-entering credentials. Saved accounts live only in your browser and tokens are encrypted before they are stored.

## How it works

- Open the avatar menu and choose **Switch Account** to see saved accounts.
- Select another account to reload the app with that session.
- Use **Add account** to sign in with another user; the new session is saved automatically.
- Remove an entry or re-authenticate it if the session has expired.
- The active account survives browser refreshes.

Note: Account switching is web-only and does not support switching between different Immich servers.
