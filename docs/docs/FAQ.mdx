## Mobile App

### What is the difference between the cloud icons on the mobile app?

| Icon                               | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![cloud](/img/cloud.svg)           | Asset is only available on the server and was uploaded from some other device (like the web client) or was deleted from this device after upload |
| ![cloud-cross](/img/cloud-off.svg) | Asset is only available locally and has not yet been backed up                                                                                   |
| ![cloud-done](/img/cloud-done.svg) | Asset was uploaded from this device and is now backed up to the server; the original file is still on the device                                 |

### I cannot log into the application after an update. What can I do?

Verify that the mobile app and server are both running the same version (major and minor).

:::note
App store updates sometimes take longer because the stores (Google Play Store and Apple App Store)
need to approve the update first, and it can take some time.
:::

If you still cannot log in to the app, try the following:

- Check the mobile logs
- Make sure login credentials are correct by logging in on the web app

### Why does foreground backup stop when I navigate away from the app? Shouldn't it transfer the job to background backup?

Foreground backup and background backup are two separate mechanisms. They don't communicate or interact with each other.

Foreground backup is controlled by the user's action, while background backup is controlled by your device's operating system. When the app is put in the background, the invocation of background tasks is delegated to the device's operating system scheduler. It decides when the background task can run and how long it can run.

The behaviors differ based on your device manufacturer and operating system, but most are related to battery-saving policies.

### Why is background backup on iOS not working?

On iOS (iPhone and iPad), the operating system determines if a particular app can invoke background tasks based on multiple factors, most of which the Immich app has no control over. To increase the likelihood that the background backup task is run, follow the steps below:

- Enable Background App Refresh for Immich in the iOS settings at `Settings > General > Background App Refresh`.
- Disable **Low Power Mode** when not needed, as this can prevent apps from running in the background.
- Disable Background App Refresh for apps that don't need background tasks to run. This will reduce the competition for background task invocation for Immich.
- Use the Immich app more often.

### Why are features in the mobile app not working with a self-signed certificate, Basic Auth, custom headers, or mutual TLS?

These network features are experimental. They often do not work with video playback, asset upload or download, and other features.
Many of these limitations are tracked in [#15230](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/issues/15230).
Instead of these experimental features, we recommend using the URL switching feature, a VPN, or a [free trusted SSL certificate](https://letsencrypt.org/) for your domain.

We are not actively developing these features and will not be able to provide support, but welcome contributions to improve them.
Please discuss any large PRs with our dev team to ensure your time is not wasted.

## Assets

### Does Immich change the file?

No, Immich does not modify the original files.
All edited metadata is saved in companion `.xmp` sidecar files and the database.
However, Immich will delete original files that have been trashed when the trash is emptied in the Immich UI.

### Why do my file names appear as a random string in the file manager?

When Storage Template is off (default) Immich saves the file names in a random string (also known as random UUIDs) to prevent duplicate file names.
To retrieve the original file names, you must enable the Storage Template and then run the STORAGE TEMPLATE MIGRATION job.
It is recommended to read about [Storage Template](https://immich.app/docs/administration/storage-template) before activation.

### Can I add my existing photo library?

Yes, with an [External Library](/docs/features/libraries.md).

### What happens to existing files after I choose a new [Storage Template](/docs/administration/storage-template.mdx)?

Template changes will only apply to _new_ assets. To retroactively apply the template to previously uploaded assets, run the Storage Migration Job, available on the [Jobs](/docs/administration/jobs-workers/#jobs) page.

### Why are only photos and not videos being uploaded to Immich?

This often happens when using a reverse proxy in front of Immich.
Make sure to [set your reverse proxy](/docs/administration/reverse-proxy/) to allow large requests.
Also, check the disk space of your reverse proxy.
In some cases, proxies cache requests to disk before passing them on, and if disk space runs out, the request fails.

If you are using Cloudflare Tunnel, please know that they set a maxiumum filesize of 100 MB that cannot be changed.
At times, files larger than this may work, potentially up to 1 GB. However, the official limit is 100 MB.
If you are having issues, we recommend switching to a different network deployment.

### Why are some photos stored in the file system with the wrong date?

There are a few different scenarios that can lead to this situation. The solution is to rerun the storage migration job.
The job is only automatically run once per asset after upload. If metadata extraction originally failed, the jobs were cleared/canceled, etc.,
the job may not have run automatically the first time.

### How can I hide photos from the timeline?

You can _archive_ them.

### How can I backup data from Immich?

See [Backup and Restore](/docs/administration/backup-and-restore.md).

### Does Immich support reading existing face tag metadata?

No, it currently does not. There is an [open feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/4348).

### Does Immich support the filtering of NSFW images?

No, it currently does not. There is an [open feature request on Github](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/2451).

### Why are there so many thumbnail generation jobs?

There are three thumbnail jobs for each asset:

- Blurred (thumbhash)
- Preview (Webp)
- Thumbnail (Jpeg)

Also, there are additional jobs for person (face) thumbnails.

### Why do files from WhatsApp not appear with the correct date?

Files sent on WhatsApp are saved without metadata on the file. Therefore, Immich has no way of knowing the original date of the file when files are uploaded from WhatsApp,
not the order of arrival on the device. [See #9116](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/9116).

### What happens if an asset exists in more than one account?

There are no requirements for assets to be unique across users. If multiple users upload the same image, it is processed as if it were a distinct asset, and jobs run and thumbnails are generated accordingly.

### Why do HDR videos appear pale in Immich player but look normal after download?

Immich uses a player with known HDR color display issues. We are experimenting with a different player that provides better color profiles for HDR content for future improvements.

### Why does Immich transcode my videos to a lower quality?

Immich always keeps your original files. Alongside that, it generates a transcoded version for compatibility and performance reasons.

### How can I delete transcoded videos without deleting the original?

The transcoded version of an asset can be deleted by setting a transcode policy that makes it unnecessary and then running a transcoding job for that asset. This can be done on a per-asset basis by starting a transcoding job for a single asset with the _Refresh encoded videos_ button in the asset viewer options or for all assets by running transcoding jobs for all assets from the administration page.

To update the transcode policy, navigate to Administration > Video Transcoding Settings > Transcoding Policy and select a policy from the drop-down. This policy will determine whether an existing transcode will be deleted or overwritten in the transcoding job. If a video should be transcoded according to this policy, an existing transcode is overwritten. If not, then it is deleted.

:::note
For example, say you have existing transcodes with the policy "Videos higher than normal resolution or not in the desired format" and switch to a narrower policy: "Videos not in the desired format." If an asset was only transcoded due to its resolution, running a transcoding job for it will delete the existing transcode. This is because resolution is no longer part of the transcode policy and the transcode is unnecessary. Likewise, if you set the policy to "Don't transcode any videos" and run transcoding jobs for all assets, this will delete all existing transcodes as they are unnecessary.
:::

### Is it possible to compress images during backup?

No. Our design principle is that the original assets should always be untouched.

---

## Albums

### Can I keep my existing album structure while importing assets into Immich?

Yes, by using the [Immich CLI](/docs/features/command-line-interface) along with the `--album` flag.

### Is there a way to reorder photos within an album?

No, not yet. For updates on this planned feature, follow the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1689).

---

## External Library

### Can I add an external library while keeping the existing album structure?

We haven't implemented an official mechanism for creating albums from external libraries, but there are some [workarounds from the community](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/4279) to help you achieve that.

### What happens to duplicates in external libraries?

Duplicate checking only exists for upload libraries, using the file hash. Furthermore, duplicate checking is not global, but _per library_. Therefore, a situation where the same file appears twice in the timeline is possible, especially for external libraries.

### Why are my edits to files not being saved in read-only external libraries?

Images in read-write external libraries (the default) can be edited as normal.
In read-only libraries (`:ro` in the `docker-compose.yml`), Immich is unable to create the `.xmp` sidecar files to store edited file metadata.
For this reason, the metadata (timestamp, location, description, star rating, etc.) cannot be edited for files in read-only external libraries.

### How are deletions of files handled in external libraries?

Immich will attempt to delete original files that have been trashed when the trash is emptied.
In read-write external libraries (the default), Immich will delete the original file.
In read-only libraries (`:ro` in the `docker-compose.yml`), files can still be trashed in the UI.
However, when the trash is emptied, the files will re-appear in the main timeline since Immich is unable to delete the original file.

---

## Machine Learning

### How does smart search work?

Immich uses CLIP models. An ML model converts each image to an "embedding", which is essentially a string of numbers that semantically encodes what is in the image. The same is done for the text that you enter when you do a search, and that text embedding is then compared with those of the images to find similar ones. As such, there are no "tags", "labels", or "descriptions" generated that you can look at. For more information about CLIP and its capabilities, read about it [here](https://openai.com/research/clip).

### How does facial recognition work?

See [How Facial Recognition Works](/docs/features/facial-recognition#how-facial-recognition-works) for details.

### How can I disable machine learning?

:::info
Disabling machine learning will result in a poor experience for searching and the 'Explore' page, as these are reliant on it to work as intended.
:::

Machine learning can be disabled under Administration > Settings > Machine Learning Settings, either entirely or by model type. For instance, you can choose to disable smart search with CLIP, but keep facial recognition enabled. This means that the machine learning service will only process the enabled jobs.

However, disabling all jobs will not disable the machine learning service itself. To prevent it from starting up at all in this case, you can comment out the `immich-machine-learning` section of the docker-compose.yml.

### I'm getting errors about models being corrupt or failing to download. What do I do?

You can delete the model cache volume, where models are downloaded. This will give the service a clean environment to download the model again. If models are failing to download entirely, you can manually download them from [Hugging Face][huggingface] and place them in the cache folder.

### Can I use a custom CLIP model?

No, this is not supported. Only models listed in the [Hugging Face][huggingface] page are compatible. Feel free to make a feature request if there's a model not listed here that you think should be added.

### I want to be able to search in other languages besides English. How can I do that?

You can change to a multilingual CLIP model. See [here](/docs/features/searching#clip-model) for instructions.

### Does Immich support Facial Recognition for videos?

Immich's machine learning feature operates on the generated thumbnail. If a face is visible in the video's thumbnail it will be picked up by facial recognition.
Scanning the entire video for faces may be implemented in the future.

### Does Immich have animal recognition?

No.
:::tip
You can use [Smart Search](/docs/features/searching.md) for this to some extent. For example, if you have a Golden Retriever and a Chihuahua, type these words in the smart search and watch the results.
:::

### I'm getting a lot of "faces" that aren't faces, what can I do?

You can increase the MIN DETECTION SCORE to 0.8 to help prevent bad thumbnails. Setting the score too high (above 0.9) might filter out too many real faces depending on the library used. If you just want to hide specific faces, you can adjust the 'MIN FACES DETECTED' setting in the administration panel  
to increase the bar for what the algorithm considers a "core face" for that person, reducing the chance of bad thumbnails being chosen.

### The immich_model-cache volume takes up a lot of space, what could be the problem?

If you installed several models and chose not to use some of them, it might be worth deleting the old models that are in immich_model-cache. To do this you can mount the model cache and remove the undesired models.

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v immich_model-cache:/mnt-models alpine sh
cd /mnt-models
ls clip/ facial-recognition/
# rm -r clip/ABC facial-recognition/DEF # delete unused models
```

</details>

## Performance

### Why is Immich slow on low-memory systems like the Raspberry Pi?

Immich optionally uses transcoding and machine learning for several features. However, it can be too heavy to run on a Raspberry Pi. You can [mitigate](/docs/FAQ#can-i-lower-cpu-and-ram-usage) this or host Immich's machine-learning container on a [more powerful system](/docs/guides/remote-machine-learning), or [disable](/docs/FAQ#how-can-i-disable-machine-learning) machine learning entirely.

### Can I lower CPU and RAM usage?

The initial backup is the most intensive due to the number of jobs running. The most CPU-intensive ones are transcoding and machine learning jobs (Smart Search, Face Detection), and to a lesser extent thumbnail generation. Here are some ways to lower their CPU usage:

- Lower the job concurrency for these jobs to 1.
- Under Settings > Transcoding Settings > Threads, set the number of threads to a low number like 1 or 2.
- Under Settings > Machine Learning Settings > Facial Recognition > Model Name, you can change the facial recognition model to `buffalo_s` instead of `buffalo_l`. The former is a smaller and faster model, albeit not as good.
  - For facial recognition on new images to work properly, You must re-run the Face Detection job for all images after this.
- At the container level, you can [set resource constraints](/docs/FAQ#can-i-limit-cpu-and-ram-usage) to lower usage further.
  - It's recommended to only apply these constraints _after_ taking some of the measures here for best performance.
- If these changes are not enough, see [above](/docs/FAQ#how-can-i-disable-machine-learning) for instructions on how to disable machine learning.

### Can I limit CPU and RAM usage?

By default, a container has no resource constraints and can use as much of a given resource as the host's kernel scheduler allows. To limit this, you can add the following to the `docker-compose.yml` block of any containers that you want to have limited resources.

<details>
<summary>docker-compose.yml</summary>

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      # Number of CPU threads
      cpus: '1.00'
      # Gigabytes of memory
      memory: '1G'
```

</details>
For more details, you can look at the [original docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/) or use this [guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-memory-limit).

Note that memory constraints work by terminating the container, so this can introduce instability if set too low.

### How can I boost machine learning speed?

:::note
This advice improves throughput, not latency. This is to say that it will make Smart Search jobs process more quickly, but it won't make searching faster.
:::

You can increase throughput by increasing the job concurrency for machine learning jobs (Smart Search, Face Detection). With higher concurrency, the host will work on more assets in parallel. You can do this by navigating to Administration > Settings > Job Settings and increasing concurrency as needed.

:::danger
On a normal machine, 2 or 3 concurrent jobs can probably max the CPU. Storage speed and latency can quickly become the limiting factor beyond this, particularly when using HDDs.

The concurrency can be increased more comfortably with a GPU, but should still not be above 16 in most cases.

Do not exaggerate with the job concurrency because you're probably thoroughly overloading the server.
:::

### My server shows Server Status Offline | Version Unknown. What can I do?

You need to [enable WebSockets](/docs/administration/reverse-proxy/) on your reverse proxy.

---

## Docker

### How can I see Immich logs?

Immich components are typically deployed using docker. To see logs for deployed docker containers, you can use the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/), specifically the `docker logs` command. For examples, see [Docker Help](/docs/guides/docker-help.md).

### How can I reduce the log verbosity of Redis?

To decrease Redis logs, you can add the following line to the `redis:` section of the `docker-compose.yml`:

`    command: redis-server --loglevel warning`

### How can I run Immich as a non-root user?

You can change the user in the container by setting the `user` argument in `docker-compose.yml` for each service.
You may need to add mount points or docker volumes for the following internal container paths:

- `immich-machine-learning:/.config`
- `immich-machine-learning:/.cache`
- `redis:/data`

The non-root user/group needs read/write access to the volume mounts, including `UPLOAD_LOCATION` and `/cache` for machine-learning.

:::note Docker Compose Volumes
The Docker Compose top level volume element does not support non-root access, all of the above volumes must be local volume mounts.
:::

For a further hardened system, you can add the following block to every container.

<details>
<summary>docker-compose.yml</summary>

```yaml
security_opt:
  # Prevent escalation of privileges after the container is started
  - no-new-privileges:true
cap_drop:
  # Prevent access to raw network traffic
  - NET_RAW
```

</details>

### How can I purge data from Immich?

Data for Immich comes in two forms:

1. **Metadata** stored in a Postgres database, stored in the `DB_DATA_LOCATION` folder (previously `pg_data` Docker volume).
2. **Files** (originals, thumbs, profile, etc.), stored in the `UPLOAD_LOCATION` folder, more [info](/docs/administration/backup-and-restore#asset-types-and-storage-locations).

:::warning
This will destroy your database and reset your instance, meaning that you start from scratch.
:::

```bash title="Remove Immich (containers and volumes)"
docker compose down -v
```

After removing the containers and volumes, there are a few directories that need to be deleted to reset Immich to a new installation. Once they are deleted, Immich can be started back up and will be a fresh installation.

- `DB_DATA_LOCATION` contains the database, media info, and settings.
- `UPLOAD_LOCATION` contains all the media uploaded to Immich.

:::note Portainer
If you use portainer, bring down the stack in portainer. Go into the volumes section  
and remove all the volumes related to immich then restart the stack.
:::

### Why does the machine learning service report workers crashing?

:::note
If the error says the worker is exiting, then this is normal. This is a feature intended to reduce RAM consumption when the service isn't being used.
:::

There are a few reasons why this can happen.

If the error mentions SIGKILL or error code 137, it most likely means the service is running out of memory.
Consider either increasing the server's RAM or moving the service to a server with more RAM.

If it mentions SIGILL (note the lack of a K) or error code 132, it most likely means your server's CPU is incompatible with Immich.

## Database

### Why am I getting database ownership errors?

If you get database errors such as `FATAL:  data directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data" has wrong ownership` upon database startup, this is likely due to an issue with your filesystem.
NTFS and ex/FAT/32 filesystems are not supported. See [here](/docs/install/requirements#special-requirements-for-windows-users) for more details.

### How can I verify the integrity of my database?

Database checksums are enabled by default for new installations since v1.104.0. You can check if they are enabled by running the following command.
A result of `on` means that checksums are enabled.

<details>
<summary>Check if checksums are enabled</summary>

```bash
docker exec -it immich_postgres psql --dbname=postgres --username=<DB_USERNAME> --command="show data_checksums"
 data_checksums
----------------
 on
(1 row)
```

</details>

If checksums are enabled, you can check the status of the database with the following command. A normal result is all `0`s.

<details>
<summary>Check for database corruption</summary>

```bash
docker exec -it immich_postgres psql --dbname=postgres --username=<DB_USERNAME> --command="SELECT datname, checksum_failures, checksum_last_failure FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname IS NOT NULL"
  datname  | checksum_failures | checksum_last_failure
-----------+-------------------+-----------------------
 postgres  |                 0 |
 immich    |                 0 |
 template1 |                 0 |
 template0 |                 0 |
(4 rows)
```

</details>

You can also scan the Postgres database file structure for errors:

<details>
<summary>Scan for file structure errors</summary>
```bash
docker exec -it immich_postgres pg_amcheck --username=postgres --heapallindexed --parent-check --rootdescend --progress --all --install-missing
```

A normal result will end something like this and return with an exit code of `0`:

```bash
7470/8832 relations (84%), 730829/734735 pages (99%)
8425/8832 relations (95%), 734367/734735 pages (99%)
8832/8832 relations (100%), 734735/734735 pages (100%)
```

</details>

If corruption is detected, you should immediately make a backup before performing any other work in the database.
To do so, you may need to set the `zero_damaged_pages=on` flag for the database server to allow `pg_dumpall` to succeed.
After taking a backup, the recommended next step is to restore the database from a healthy backup before corruption was detected.
The damaged database dump can be used to manually recover any changes made since the last backup, if needed.

The causes of possible corruption are many, but can include unexpected poweroffs or unmounts, use of a network share for Postgres data, or a poor storage medium such an SD card or failing HDD/SSD.
