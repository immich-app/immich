## Step 1 - Download the required files

Create a directory of your choice (e.g. `./immich-app`) to hold the `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files.

```bash title="Move to the directory you created"
mkdir ./immich-app
cd ./immich-app
```

Download [`docker-compose.yml`][compose-file] and [`example.env`][env-file] by running the following commands:

```bash title="Get docker-compose.yml file"
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
```

```bash title="Get .env file"
wget -O .env https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env
```

You can alternatively download these two files from your browser and move them to the directory that you created, in which case ensure that you rename `example.env` to `.env`.

## Step 2 - Populate the .env file with custom values

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="Default environmental variable content">
  {ExampleEnv}
</CodeBlock>

- Populate `UPLOAD_LOCATION` with your preferred location for storing backup assets. It should be a new directory on the server with enough free space.
- Consider changing `DB_PASSWORD` to a custom value. Postgres is not publicly exposed, so this password is only used for local authentication.
  To avoid issues with Docker parsing this value, it is best to use only the characters `A-Za-z0-9`. `pwgen` is a handy utility for this.
- Set your timezone by uncommenting the `TZ=` line.
- Populate custom database information if necessary.

## Step 3 - Start the containers

From the directory you created in Step 1 (which should now contain your customized `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files), run the following command to start Immich as a background service:

```bash title="Start the containers"
docker compose up -d
```
