Now that you have imported some pictures, you should setup server backups to preserve your memories.
You can do so by following our [backup guide](/administration/backup-and-restore.md).

A 3-2-1 backup strategy is still crucial. The team has the responsibility to ensure that the application doesnâ€™t cause loss of your precious memories; however, we cannot guarantee that hard drives will not fail, or an electrical event causes unexpected shutdown of your server/system, leading to data loss. Therefore, we still encourage users to follow best practices when safeguarding their data. Keep multiple copies of your most precious data: at least two local copies and one copy offsite in cold storage.
