## Set Storage Quota For User

Admin can specify the storage quota for the user as the instance's admin; once the limit is reached, the user won't be able to upload to the instance anymore.

In order to select a storage quota, click on the pencil icon and enter the storage quota in GiB. You can choose an unlimited quota using the value 0 (default).

:::tip
The system administrator can see the usage quota percentage of all users in Server Stats page.
:::

:::info
External libraries don't take up space from the storage quota.

## Set Storage Label For User

The admin can add a custom label for each user, so instead of `upload/{userId}/your-template` it will be `upload/{custom_user_label}/your-template`.  
To apply a storage template, go to the Administration page -> click on the pencil button next to the user.
:::note
To apply the Storage Label to previously uploaded assets, run the Storage Migration Job.
