# Backup and Restore

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

A [3-2-1 backup strategy](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) is recommended to protect your data. You should keep copies of your uploaded photos/videos as well as the Immich database for a comprehensive backup solution. This page provides an overview on how to backup the database and the location of user-uploaded pictures and videos. A template bash script that can be run as a cron job is provided [here](/docs/guides/template-backup-script.md)

## Database

:::caution
Immich saves [file paths in the database](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/3299), it does not scan the library folder to update the database so backups are crucial.
:::

:::info
Refer to the official [postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html) for details about backing up and restoring a postgres database.
:::

:::caution
It is not recommended to directly backup the `DB_DATA_LOCATION` folder. Doing so while the database is running can lead to a corrupted backup that cannot be restored.
:::

### Automatic Database Backups

Immich will automatically create database backups by default. The backups are stored in `UPLOAD_LOCATION/backups`.  
You can adjust the schedule and amount of kept backups in the [admin settings](http://my.immich.app/admin/system-settings?isOpen=backup).  
By default, Immich will keep the last 14 backups and create a new backup every day at 2:00 AM.

#### Restoring

We hope to make restoring simpler in future versions, for now you can find the backups in the `UPLOAD_LOCATION/backups` folder on your host.  
Then please follow the steps in the following section for restoring the database.

### Manual Backup and Restore

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Linux system" label="Linux system" default>

```bash title='Backup'
docker exec -t immich_postgres pg_dumpall --clean --if-exists --username=postgres | gzip > "/path/to/backup/dump.sql.gz"
```

```bash title='Restore'
docker compose down -v  # CAUTION! Deletes all Immich data to start from scratch
## Uncomment the next line and replace DB_DATA_LOCATION with your Postgres path to permanently reset the Postgres database
# rm -rf DB_DATA_LOCATION # CAUTION! Deletes all Immich data to start from scratch
docker compose pull             # Update to latest version of Immich (if desired)
docker compose create           # Create Docker containers for Immich apps without running them
docker start immich_postgres    # Start Postgres server
sleep 10                        # Wait for Postgres server to start up
# Check the database user if you deviated from the default
gunzip < "/path/to/backup/dump.sql.gz" \
| sed "s/SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false);/SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', 'public, pg_catalog', true);/g" \
| docker exec -i immich_postgres psql --username=postgres  # Restore Backup
docker compose up -d            # Start remainder of Immich apps
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows system (PowerShell)" label="Windows system (PowerShell)">

```powershell title='Backup'
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllLines("C:\absolute\path\to\backup\dump.sql", (docker exec -t immich_postgres pg_dumpall --clean --if-exists --username=postgres))
```

```powershell title='Restore'
docker compose down -v  # CAUTION! Deletes all Immich data to start from scratch
## Uncomment the next line and replace DB_DATA_LOCATION with your Postgres path to permanently reset the Postgres database
# Remove-Item -Recurse -Force DB_DATA_LOCATION # CAUTION! Deletes all Immich data to start from scratch
## You should mount the backup (as a volume, example: - 'C:\path\to\backup\dump.sql':/dump.sql) into the immich_postgres container using the docker-compose.yml
docker compose pull             # Update to latest version of Immich (if desired)
docker compose create           # Create Docker containers for Immich apps without running them
docker start immich_postgres    # Start Postgres server
sleep 10                        # Wait for Postgres server to start up
docker exec -it immich_postgres bash    # Enter the Docker shell and run the following command
# Check the database user if you deviated from the default
cat "/dump.sql" \
| sed "s/SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false);/SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', 'public, pg_catalog', true);/g" \
| psql --username=postgres      # Restore Backup
exit                            # Exit the Docker shell
docker compose up -d            # Start remainder of Immich apps
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that for the database restore to proceed properly, it requires a completely fresh install (i.e. the Immich server has never run since creating the Docker containers). If the Immich app has run, Postgres conflicts may be encountered upon database restoration (relation already exists, violated foreign key constraints, multiple primary keys, etc.), in which case you need to delete the `DB_DATA_LOCATION` folder to reset the database.

:::tip
Some deployment methods make it difficult to start the database without also starting the server. In these cases, you may set the environment variable `DB_SKIP_MIGRATIONS=true` before starting the services. This will prevent the server from running migrations that interfere with the restore process. Be sure to remove this variable and restart the services after the database is restored.
:::

## Filesystem

Immich stores two types of content in the filesystem: (1) original, unmodified assets (photos and videos), and (2) generated content. Only the original content needs to be backed-up, which is stored in the following folders:

1. `UPLOAD_LOCATION/library`
2. `UPLOAD_LOCATION/upload`
3. `UPLOAD_LOCATION/profile`

:::caution
If you moved some of these folders onto a different storage device, such as `profile/`, make sure to adjust the backup path to match your setup
:::

### Asset Types and Storage Locations

Some storage locations are impacted by the Storage Template. See below for more details.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Storage Template Off (Default)." label="Storage Template Off (Default)." default>

:::note
The `UPLOAD_LOCATION/library` folder is not used by default on new machines running version 1.92.0. It is used only if the system administrator activated the storage template engine,

When you turn off the storage template engine, it will leave the assets in `UPLOAD_LOCATION/library/<userID>` and will not return them to `UPLOAD_LOCATION/upload`.  
**New assets** will be saved to `UPLOAD_LOCATION/upload`.

Do not touch the files inside these folders under any circumstances except taking a backup. Changing or removing an asset can cause untracked and missing files.
You can think of it as App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named, the only access to viewing, changing and deleting assets is only through the mobile or browser interface.
