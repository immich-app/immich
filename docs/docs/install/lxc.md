# LXC [Community]

:::note
This is a community contribution and not officially supported by the Immich team, but included here for convenience.

**Please report issues to the corresponding Github Repository**
:::

Because "using Docker inside LXC is not recommended" ([source](https://immich.app/docs/install/requirements#hardware)), we built a dedicate script for install Immich under LXC environment.

## Flavours

### CPU-only 

[Immich Native](https://github.com/arter97/immich-native)

This is a straight-forward and stable installation script and guide, written by arter97.

### With Hardware Acceleration on Ubuntu/Debian

[Immich in LXC](https://github.com/loeeeee/immich-in-lxc)

This installation script is based on Arter97's.

## Issues

For issues, open an issue on the associated GitHub Repository.
