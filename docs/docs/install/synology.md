# Synology [Community]

:::note
This is a community contribution and not officially supported by the Immich team, but included here for convenience.

Immich can easily be installed on a Synology NAS using Container Manager within DSM. If you have not installed Container Manager already, you can install it in the Packages Center. Refer to the [Container Manager docs](https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/help/ContainerManager/docker_desc?version=7) for more information on using Container Manager.

## Step 1 - Download the required files

Create a directory of your choice (e.g. `./immich-app`) to house Immich. In general, it's best practice to have all Docker-based applications running under the `./docker` directory, so in this case, your directory structure will look like `./docker/immich-app`.

Now create a `./postgres` and `./library` directory as sub-directories of the `./docker/immich-app`.

When you're all done, you should have the following:

- `./docker/immich-app/postgres`
- `./docker/immich-app/library`

Download [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml) and [`example.env`](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env) to your computer. Upload the files to the `./docker/immich-app` directory, and rename `example.env` to `.env`. Note: If you plan to use the Synology Text editor to edit the `.env` file on the NAS within File Station, you will need to rename it to a temporary name (e.g. `example.txt`) in order to see 'Open with Text Editor' in the file context menu. Once saved, rename it back to `.env`.

## Step 2 - Populate the .env file with custom values

Follow [Step 2 in Docker Compose](/install/docker-compose#step-2---populate-the-env-file-with-custom-values) for instructions on customizing the `.env` file, and then return back to this guide to continue.

## Step 3 - Create a new project in Container Manager

Open Container Manager, and select the "**Project**" action on the left navigation bar and then click "**Create**".
![Create project](../../static/img/synology-container-manager-create-project.png)

In the settings of your new project, set "**Project name**" to a name you'll remember, such as _immich-app_. When setting the "**Path**", select the `./docker/immich-app` directory you created earlier. Doing so will prompt a message to use the existing `docker-compose.yml` already present in the directory for your project. Click "**OK**" to continue.

![Set path](../../static/img/synology-container-manager-set-path.png)

The following screen will give you the option to further customize your `docker-compose.yml` file. Take note of `DB_STORAGE_TYPE: 'HDD'`and uncomment if applicable for your Synology setup.

![DB storage](../../static/img/synology-container-manager-customize-docker-compose.png)

Skip the section asking to set-up a portal for Web Station, and then complete the wizard which will build and start the containers for your project.

Once your containers are successfully running, navigate to the "**Container**" section of Container Manager, right-click on the "**immich-server**" container, and choose the "**Details**".

Scroll to the bottom of the "**Details**" section and find the `IP Address` listed in the `Network` section. Take note of the container's IP address as you will need it for **Step 4**.

## Step 4 - Configure Firewall Settings

Once your project completes the build process, your containers will start. In order to be able to access Immich from your browser, you need to configure the firewall settings for your Synology NAS.

Open "**Control Panel**" on your Synology NAS, and select "**Security**". Navigate to "**Firewall**"

![Firewall rules](../../static/img/synology-firewall-rules.png)

Click "**Edit Rules**" and add the following firewall rules:

- Add a "**Source IP**" rule for the IP address of your container that you obtained in Step 3 above

![IP address rule](../../static/img/synology-ipaddress-firewall-rule.png)

- Add a "**Ports**" rule for the port specified in the `docker-compose.yml`, which should be `2283`

## Next Steps

Read the [Post Installation](/install/post-install.mdx) steps and [upgrade instructions](/install/upgrading.md).

  <summary>Updating Immich using Container Manager</summary>
Check the post installation and upgrade instructions at the links above before proceeding with this section.

## Step 1. Backup

Ensure your photos and videos are backed up. Your `.env` settings will define where they are stored. There is no need to delete any files or folders within the `docker` folder when doing a release upgrade unless instructed in the release notes.

## Step 2. Check release notes

Always check the [release notes](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases) before proceeding with an update!

## Step 3. Stop containers & clean up

Open **Container Manager**. Select **Project** then your Immich app

![Select project](../../static/img/synology-select-proj.png)

Select **Stop**

![Stop project](../../static/img/synology-project-stop.png)

Select **Action** then **Clean**. This removes the containers.

![Clean project](../../static/img/synology-action-clean.png)

Go to **Image** and select **Remove Unused Images**.

![Remove unused](../../static/img/synology-remove-unused.png)

## Step 4. Build

Go to **Project**, select **Action** then **Build**. This will download, unpack, install and start the containers.

![Build](../../static/img/synology-build.png)

## Step 5. Update firewall rule

The default behavior is to automatically start the containers once installed. If `immich_server` runs for a few seconds and then stops, it may be because the firewall rule no longer matches the server IP address.

Go to the **Container** section. Click on `immich_server` and scroll down on **General** to find the IP address.
![Container IP](../../static/img/synology-container-ip.png)

Go to Synology **Control Panel**. Select **Security** and **Firewall**.

![Firewall](../../static/img/synology-fw-rules.png)

In this example, the IP addresses mismatch and the firewall rule needs to be edited to match above.
