# Config File

A config file can be provided as an alternative to the UI configuration.

### Step 1 - Create a new config file

In JSON format, create a new config file (e.g. `immich.json`) and put it in a location that can be accessed by Immich.
The default configuration looks like this:

<details>
<summary>immich.json</summary>

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import { defaults } from '../../../server/src/config.ts';

<CodeBlock language="json">{defaults}</CodeBlock>

</details>

:::tip
In Administration > Settings is a button to copy the current configuration to your clipboard.
So you can just grab it from there, paste it into a file and you're pretty much good to go.

### Step 2 - Specify the file location

In your `.env` file, set the variable `IMMICH_CONFIG_FILE` to the path of your config.
For more information, refer to the [Environment Variables](/install/environment-variables.md) section.

:::tip
YAML-formatted config files are also supported.
