# Support The Project

## Report issues

By far the easiest way to help make Immich better it to use it and report issues and bugs. Found a bug? [Open an issue on GitHub][github-issue].

## Translations

Support the project by localizing on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/immich/immich/). For more information, see the [Translations](/docs/developer/translations) section.

## Development

If you are a programmer or developer, take a look at Immich's [technology stack](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) and consider fixing bugs or building new features. The team and I are always looking for new contributors. For information about how to contribute as a developer, see the [Developer](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) section.

## Purchase Immich

You can also [purchase Immich](https://buy.immich.app), for either one user or your entire server. Building Immich takes a lot of time and effort, and we have full-time engineers working on it to make it as good as we possibly can, so any support is greatly appreciated. Don't worry, all features will be free, forever! Nothing will ever be put behind any paywalls.
