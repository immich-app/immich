# Logo meaning

Why the colorful flower, you asked?

I really like the Japanese culture, especially books, history, and food. The current logo is a spin-off of [the Oda clan's symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_clan).

One of my favorite books is [Taikō](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/336228.Taiko), it is the story about a prominent figure in the history of Japan, [Toyotomy Hideyoshi](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Toyotomi-Hideyoshi). He came from nothing, and through resilient and his wonderful mind, he has become one of the most powerful ruler in Japan's history. I enjoy his personality and the way he moved through life.

The color is an adaptation of **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_**'s color scheme, with an extra color (pink) to complete the flower's fifth petals. The petal layers are the same color scheme as the main layer rotating back and forth to "bring the flower to life."
