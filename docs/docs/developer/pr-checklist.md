# PR Checklist

A minimal devcontainer is supplied with this repository. All commands can be executed directly inside this container to avoid tedious installation of the environment.
:::warning
The provided devcontainer isn't complete at the moment. At least all dockerized steps in the Makefile won't work (`make dev`, ....). Feel free to contribute!

When contributing code through a pull request, please check the following:

## Web Checks

## Mobile Checks

The following commands must be executed from within the mobile app directory of the codebase.

- [ ] `make build` (auto-generate files using build_runner)
- [ ] `make analyze` (static analysis via Dart Analyzer and DCM)

## OpenAPI

The OpenAPI client libraries need to be regenerated whenever there are changes to the `immich-openapi-specs.json` file. Note that you should not modify this file directly as it is auto-generated. See [OpenAPI](/docs/developer/open-api.md) for more details.

## Database Migrations

A database migration needs to be generated whenever there are changes to `server/src/infra/src/entities`. See [Database Migration](/docs/developer/database-migrations.md) for more details.
