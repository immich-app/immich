# Testing

## Server

### Unit tests

Unit are run by calling `pnpm run test` from the `server/` directory.
You need to run `pnpm install` (in `server/`) before _once_.

### End to end tests

The e2e tests can be run by first starting up a test production environment via:

```bash
make e2e
```

Before you can run the tests, you need to run the following commands _once_:

- `pnpm install` (in `e2e/`)
- `make open-api` (in the project root `/`)

Once the test environment is running, the e2e tests can be run via:

```bash
cd e2e/
pnpm test
```

The tests check various things including:

- Authentication and authorization
- Query param, body, and url validation
- Response codes
- Thumbnail generation
- Metadata extraction
- Library scanning
