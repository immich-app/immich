Hello everyone, it is my pleasure to deliver the new release of Immich to you. The team has been working hard to bring you the new features and improvements. This release includes some big features that the community has been asking since the beginning of Immich. We hope you will enjoy it.

Some notable features are:

- [OAuth integration](#livephoto-ios-support-)
- [LivePhoto support on iOS](#oauth-integration-)
- User config system

<!--truncate-->

## LivePhoto iOS Support 🎉

LivePhoto on iOS is now supported in Immich.

The motion part will now be uploaded and can be played on the mobile app and the web.

:::caution

- The server and the app has to be on version **1.36.x** for the application to work correctly.
- Previous uploaded photos will not be updated automatically, you will have to remove and reupload them if you want to keep the LivePhoto functionality.

## OAuth Integration 🎉

I want to borrow this chance to express my gratitude to [@EnricoBilla](https://github.com/EnricoBilla), who has been the trailblazer for this feature since the beginning days of Immich. His PR has sparked ideas, suggestions, and discussion among the team member on how to integrate this feature successfully into the app. Thank you so much for your work and your time.
