/**
 * A variant of {@link Subject} that "replays" old values to new subscribers by emitting them when they first subscribe.
 *
 * `ReplaySubject` has an internal buffer that will store a specified number of values that it has observed. Like `Subject`,
 * `ReplaySubject` "observes" values by having them passed to its `next` method. When it observes a value, it will store that
 * value for a time determined by the configuration of the `ReplaySubject`, as passed to its constructor.
 *
 * When a new subscriber subscribes to the `ReplaySubject` instance, it will synchronously emit all values in its buffer in
 * a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. The `ReplaySubject` will also complete, if it has observed completion; and it will
 * error if it has observed an error.
 *
 * There are two main configuration items to be concerned with:
 *
 * 1. `bufferSize` - This will determine how many items are stored in the buffer, defaults to infinite.
 * 2. `windowTime` - The amount of time to hold a value in the buffer before removing it from the buffer.
 *
 * Both configurations may exist simultaneously. So if you would like to buffer a maximum of 3 values, as long as the values
 * are less than 2 seconds old, you could do so with a `new ReplaySubject(3, 2000)`.
 *
 * ### Differences with BehaviorSubject
 *
 * `BehaviorSubject` is similar to `new ReplaySubject(1)`, with a couple fo exceptions:
 *
 * 1. `BehaviorSubject` comes "primed" with a single value upon construction.
 * 2. `ReplaySubject` will replay values, even after observing an error, where `BehaviorSubject` will not.
 *

 * @see {@link BehaviorSubject}
 * @see {@link shareReplay}
