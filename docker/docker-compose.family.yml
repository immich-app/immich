#
# Family Photo Sharing Mode - Simplified Immich without ML
#
# This is a simplified version of Immich focused on family photo sharing.
# It disables ML features (face recognition, smart search, OCR) for a
# lighter deployment and simpler experience.
#
# Features:
# - Photo upload and browsing
# - Albums with sharing
# - Likes and comments
# - Memories/flashbacks (date-based, no ML)
# - Invite-only registration
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy .env.example to .env and configure
# 2. Set IMMICH_FAMILY_MODE=true in .env
# 3. Run: docker compose -f docker-compose.family.yml up -d
