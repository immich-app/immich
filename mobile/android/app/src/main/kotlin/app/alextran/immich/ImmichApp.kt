    // After the process is killed (by user or system), the first trigger (taking a new picture) is lost.
    // Thus, the BackupWorker is not started. If the system kills the process after each initialization
    // (because of low memory etc.), the backup is never performed.
    // As a workaround, we also run a backup check when initializing the application
