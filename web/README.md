# Immich web project

This project uses the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) web framework. Please refer to [the SvelteKit docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) for information on getting started as a contributor to this project. In particular, it will help you navigate the project's code if you understand the basics of [SvelteKit routing](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing).

When developing locally, you will run a SvelteKit Node.js server. When this project is deployed to production, it is built as a SPA and deployed as part of [the server project](../server).
